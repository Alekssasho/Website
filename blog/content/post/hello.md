Hello, I am Aleksandar, you can read more about me in the [About](/about) page.

I am starting a blog to share technical experiance and knowledge.
I am mostly interested in game development, engine programming, computer graphics, so probably most of the posts will be about that.

### Details about the implementation of the blog.

The site is static and generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The blog site is using [Hello-Friend Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend/). There is second site embeded inside for the [Resume](/resume). This is because it used another theme - [Orbit](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-orbit-theme/).

The hosting is through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source code is [here](https://github.com/Alekssasho/Website).
