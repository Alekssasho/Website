<h2>> Hi there<span class="logo__cursor" style="width: 3px; height: 1.625rem;"></span></h2>

My name is Aleksandar, software developer coming from Sofia, Bulgaria.

I live and breathe games - when I' m not developing and programming I play them.
My interested in game development are mainly in engine architecture and graphics.

Currently I work in [Coherent Labs](https://coherent-labs.com), where I am Senior Graphics Developer. 

Also I am finishing my Master degree in Computer Graphics in [Sofia University](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en). My thesis work
is for Global Illumination algorithms for games.

Some of mine most loved games are The Witcher series, Horizon Zero Dawn, Mass Effect, Dragon Age. I m also huge fan of board games and also card games like Magic The Gathering, Android Netrunner, etc.
